# Developing Control Add-ins using AL language

This repository contains exercise solutions for the **Developing Control Add-ins using AL language** workshop. If you are a workshop attendee or simply want to learn about how to create Control Add-ins using AL, this repository can help you get started.

The repository is divided into three branches, corresponding to the workshop exercises:

Each branch contains the final state of the solution after the exercise has been completed.

## Ecercise A

In this exercise, you create an AL workspace that contains:
- A control add-in object showing Google Maps using Google Maps JavaScript API
- A page part hosting the Google Maps control add-in
- A page extension that adds the Google Maps page part to the customer card page

The workspace also contains minimum code to initialize the Google Maps control and to center the map on a location of Microsoft Dynamics Business Central headquarters in Lyngby, Denmark.
